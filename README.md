# Games for Numworks Calculators

I've been working on making apps for [Numworks](https://numworks.com) Calculators, and these are the results so far. Keep in mind that I have a Numworks model N0110, and so these binaries are only being tested on that. Unless the apps need the full 8mb of storage on the N0110, they should work on the N0100. There is also a high chance that they work on the new N0120.

- [ ] Flappy Bird (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Pong
- [ ] Platformer Gameâ€¦ (maybe????)

P.S. Excuse the horrible code and organization, I'm in high school.
